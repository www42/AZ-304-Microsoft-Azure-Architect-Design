# Lab: Implementing Containers on Azure
# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

Adatum Corporation became interested in containerization a few years ago, before it started entertaining the idea of migrating some of its workloads to Azure. Since then, its developers and engineers implemented a wide range of Docker-based applications, running on Windows Server 2016 and Linux Ubuntu 16.04. The Enterprise Architecture team also designed and assisted with implementation of an on-premises deployments of Kubernetes clusters to host a number more complex, containerized multi-tier applications. However, operational teams that took over management and maintenance of the clusters has been complaining about significant administrative overhead.

As part of the initiative of migrating on-premises workloads to Azure, the Enterprise Architecture team wants to evaluate different methods of running containerized apps in the cloud. While it is apparent that it is possible to deploy containers to Azure VMs in order to mirror their on-premises deployment model, the use of managed offerings, such as Azure Container Instances (ACI) and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is considerably more compelling since it minimizes administrative overhead and offers additional agility and cost reduction benefits. The portability, inherent to containerization technologies, provides flexibility when choosing the target platform. 

Azure Container Instances offers the fastest and simplest way to run a container in Azure, without having to manage virtual machines or having to adopt a higher-level service. Azure Container Instances provide some of the basic scheduling capabilities of orchestration platforms, including all the scheduling and management capabilities required to run a single container

Azure Kubernetes Service accommodates scenarios that require full container orchestration, including service discovery across multiple containers, automatic scaling, and coordinated application upgrades. It is also possible to combine benefits of ACI and AKS, by using the orchestrator platforms to manage multi-container tasks running within ACIs.

In order to evaluate these capabilities, the Adatum Architecture team wants to test the following scenarios that involve the use of Docker containers on Azure:

-  containers running in Azure VMs

-  containers running in Azure Container Instances

-  container orchestration by using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)


## Objectives

   ```sh
   LOCATION='Azure region'
   az deployment sub create \
   --location $LOCATION \
   --template-file azuredeploy30306suba.json \
   --parameters rgName=az30306a-LabRG rgLocation=$LOCATION

   FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:3.0 AS build
   WORKDIR /app

   # copy csproj and restore as distinct layers
   COPY *.sln .
   COPY aspnetapp/*.csproj ./aspnetapp/

   WORKDIR /app
   COPY --from=build /app/aspnetapp/out ./
   ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "aspnetapp.dll"]
   ```

      > **Note**: This Dockerfile builds an app first and then uses the resulting build to create an image containing the app release with runtime components only.

1. From the Command Prompt, run the following to build a container image for the app in the **dotnet-docker/samples/aspnetapp/aspnetapp** folder:

   ```cmd
   docker build -t aspnetapp .

   ```cmd
   docker create -p 5000:80 --name aspnetapp-container aspnetapp
   ```

1. From the Command Prompt, run the following to verify that the container hosting the app has been created, but is not yet running:

   ```cmd
   docker ps -a
   ```

1. From the Command Prompt, run the following to start the newly created container:

   ```cmd
   docker start aspnetapp-container
   ```

1. To verify that the container hosting the app is running, start Internet Explorer and browse to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). Ignore the message **This site is not secure**, select **More information** and **Go on to the webpage (not recommended)**, and verify that the **Welcome to .NET Core** message is displayed.

1. From the Command Prompt, run the following to view the running container:

   ```cmd
   docker ps -a
   ```

1. From the Command Prompt, run the following to stop the running container:

   ```cmd
   docker stop aspnetapp-container
   ```

1. From the Command Prompt, run the following to view the stopped container:

   ```cmd
   docker ps -a
   ```

1. From the Command Prompt, run the following to remove the stopped container:

   ```cmd
   docker rm aspnetapp-container
   ```

               cpu: .1
               memory: 300M
           ports:
             - containerPort: 80
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: aspnetapp
   ---
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: aspnetapp
   spec:
     type: LoadBalancer
     ports:
     - protocol: TCP
       port: 80
     selector:
       app: aspnetapp
   ```

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to deploy resources defined in the **aspnetapp.yaml** file: 

   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f aspnetapp.yaml
   ```

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to verify that the deployment resulted in creation of a single pod:

   kubectl get pods
   ```

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to identify the external IP address associated with the **LoadBalancer** service:

   ```sh
   kubectl get service aspnetapp
   ```

    >**Note**: You might have to wait a few minutes and rerun this command in order to identify the external IP address.

1. To verify that the app is running, start Internet Explorer, browse to the external IP address you identified in the previous step, and verify that the **Welcome to .NET Core** message is displayed. 


#### Task 3: Remove Azure resources deployed in the lab

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to list the resource group you created in this exercise:

   ```sh
   az group list --query "[?starts_with(name,'az30306')]".name --output tsv
   ```

    > **Note**: Verify that the output contains only the resource group you created in this lab. This group will be deleted in this task.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to delete the resource group you created in this lab

   ```sh
   az group list --query "[?starts_with(name,'az30306')]".name --output tsv | xargs -L1 bash -c 'az group delete --name $0 --no-wait --yes'
