# Lab: Implement Azure Logic Apps integration with Azure Event Grid
# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario
Adatum Corporation has an extensive set of on-premises network monitoring framework that rely on the combination of agent-based and agentless solutions to provide visibility into any changes to its environment. The agentless solutions tend to be relatively inefficient since they rely on polling to determine state changes. 

As Adatum is preparing to migrate some of its workloads to Azure, its Enterprise Architecture team wants to address these inefficiencies and evaluate the use of event driven architecture available in the cloud. The notion of using events in a solution or application is not new to the team. In fact, they have been promoting the idea of event-driven programming among its developers. One of the core tenets of an event-driven architecture is to reverse the dependencies that existing services may have with each other. Azure provides this functionality by relying on Event Grid, which is a fully managed service that supports the routing of events by utilizing a publisher-subscriber model. At its core, Event Grid is an event routing service that manages the routing and delivery of events from numerous sources and subscribers.

An event is created by a publisher such as a Blob Storage account, an Azure resource group, or even an Azure subscription. As events occur, they are published to an endpoint called a topic that the Event Grid service manages to digest all incoming messages. Event publishers are not limited to services on Azure. It is possible to use events that originate from custom applications or systems that can run from anywhere. This includes applications that are hosted on-premises, in a datacenter, or even on other clouds, if they can post an HTTP request to the Event Grid service.

Event handlers include several Azure services, including serverless technologies such as Functions, Logic Apps, or Azure Automation. Handlers are registered with Event Grid by creating an event subscription. If the event handler endpoint is publicly accessible and encrypted by Transport Layer Security, then messages can be pushed to it from Event Grid.

Unlike many other Azure services, there is no Event Grid namespace that needs to be provisioned or managed. Topics for native Azure resources are built in and completely transparent to users while custom topics are provisioned ad hoc and exist in a resource group. Event subscriptions are simply associated with a topic. This model simplifies management of topics as subscriptions and makes Event Grid highly multi-tenant, allowing for massive scale out.

Azure Event Grid is agnostic to any language or platform. While it integrates natively with Azure services, it can just as easily be leveraged by anything that supports the HTTP protocol, which makes it a very clever and innovative service.

To explore this functionality, the Adatum Architecture team wants to test integration of Azure Logic Apps with Event Grid to:

-  detect when the state of a designated Azure VM is changed

-  automatically generate an email notification in response to the event


## Objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

-  Integrate Azure Logic Apps with Event Grid

-  Trigger execution of Logic Apps in response to an event representing a change to a resource within a resource group

## Instructions

### Exercise 0: Prepare the lab environment

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

 1. Deploy an Azure VM by using an Azure Resource Manager template


#### Task 1: Deploy an Azure VM by using an Azure Resource Manager template

1. From your lab computer, start a web browser, navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and sign in by providing credentials of a user account with the Owner role in the subscription you will be using in this lab.

1. In the Azure portal, open **Cloud Shell** pane by selecting on the toolbar icon directly to the right of the search textbox.

1. If prompted to select either **Bash** or **PowerShell**, select **PowerShell**. 

    >**Note**: If this is the first time you are starting **Cloud Shell** and you are presented with the **You have no storage mounted** message, select the subscription you are using in this lab, and select **Create storage**. 

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to register the **Microsoft.EventGrid** provider in your subscription:

   ```powershell
   Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace 'Microsoft.EventGrid'
   ```

1. In the toolbar of the Cloud Shell pane, select the **Upload/Download files** icon, in the drop-down menu select **Upload**, and upload the file **\\\\AZ304\\AllFiles\Labs\\04\\azuredeploy30304suba.json** into the Cloud Shell home directory.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create a resource groups (replace the `<Azure region>` placeholder with the name of the Azure region that is available for deployment of Azure VMs in your subscription and which is closest to the location of your lab computer):

   ```powershell
   $location = '<Azure region>'
   New-AzSubscriptionDeployment `
     -Location $location `
     -Name az30304subaDeployment `
     -TemplateFile $HOME/azuredeploy30304suba.json `
     -rgLocation $location `
     -rgName 'az30304a-labRG'
   ```

      > **Note**: To identify Azure regions where you can provision Azure VMs, refer to [**https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions/offers/**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions/offers/)

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, upload the Azure Resource Manager template **\\\\AZ304\\AllFiles\Labs\\04\\azuredeploy30304rga.json**.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, upload the Azure Resource Manager parameter file **\\\\AZ304\\AllFilesLabs\\04\\azuredeploy30304rga.parameters.json**.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to deploy a Azure VM running Windows Server 2019 that you will be using in this lab:

   ```powershell
   New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
     -Name az30304rgaDeployment `
     -ResourceGroupName 'az30304a-labRG' `
     -TemplateFile $HOME/azuredeploy30304rga.json `
     -TemplateParameterFile $HOME/azuredeploy30304rga.parameters.json `
     -AsJob
   ```

    > **Note**: Do not wait for the deployment to complete but instead proceed to the next exercise. The deployment should take less than 5 minutes.

1. In the Azure portal, close the **Cloud Shell** pane. 


### Exercise 1: Configure authentication and authorization for an Azure logic app

1. Create an Azure Active Directory service principal

1. Assign the Reader role to the Azure AD service principal 


#### Task 1: Create an Azure Active Directory service principal

1. In the Azure portal, start a **PowerShell** session within the **Cloud Shell**. 

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create a new Azure AD application that you will associate with the service principal you create in the subsequent steps of this task:

   ```powershell
   $password = 'Pa55w.rd1234.@z304'
   $securePassword = ConvertTo-SecureString -Force -AsPlainText -String $password
   $az30304aadapp = New-AzADApplication -DisplayName 'az30304aadsp' -HomePage 'http://az30304aadsp' -IdentifierUris 'http://az30304aadsp' -Password $securePassword
   ```

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create a new Azure AD service principal associated with the application you created in the previous step:

   ```powershell
   New-AzADServicePrincipal -ApplicationId $az30304aadapp.ApplicationId.Guid -SkipAssignment
   ```

1. In the output of the **New-AzADServicePrincipal** command, note the value of the **ApplicationId** property. You will need it later in this exercise.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to identify the value of the **Id** property of the current Azure subscription and the value of the **TenantId** property of the Azure AD tenant associated with that subscription (you will also need them later in this exercise):
